# Third-Party Notices and Media Binary Provenance

This file describes third-party code shipped by the installable Silo Apple
applications. Build and release tools that do not ship in an application
bundle are outside its scope. Complete license texts are committed under
`iosApp/Resources/OpenSourceLicenses/`. The shared resource source configures
them for the iOS, tvOS, and macOS applications, with a local reader at
Settings > About > Open Source Licenses. Generated-project and built-bundle
verification is still required.

The authoritative dependency lock is
`iosApp/Silo.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/Package.resolved`.

## Shipped package products

| Component | Exact revision | Shipped form | License |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AetherEngine 6.67.2 + Silo handover/subtitle patches | `f8239c206097c88b53492b281af15cf906c8295b` | Swift package target linked into each host app | LGPL-3.0-only with AetherEngine's Apple Store / DRM exception |
| FFmpegBuild 3.0.0 | `421e13be7061de67d91b85ac34a6b22a002b164f` | Nine separately embedded dynamic frameworks | See the component table below |
| LibDovi 2.1.0 | `0d7cce1d6836a30d13a3a2326e50a153af53f014` | Static `Dovi.xcframework` linked through AetherEngine | MIT packaging; embedded libdovi is MIT |
| Nuke and NukeUI 13.2.0 | `30f7a7e72e0607d304fbf69c799474bd5fb6d1ce` | Swift package targets linked into each host app | MIT |

SwiftPM also resolves SMBClient 0.3.1 because AetherEngine publishes an
optional `AetherEngineSMB` product. Silo depends only on the `AetherEngine`
product. `AetherEngineSMB` and SMBClient are not linked or copied into Silo's
app targets, so SMBClient is not a shipped component and its notice is not
included here.

## AetherEngine

Copyright (C) 2026 Vincent Herbst.

AetherEngine is licensed under GNU LGPL version 3 with its upstream Apple
Store / DRM exception. Silo builds a published fork revision: upstream release
`6.67.2` plus Silo patches for host-requested native item handover, complete
native subtitle renditions, source timing after a media reanchor, and ASS
subtitle routing. Raw ASS events stay on the primary local overlay; secondary
subtitles and software PiP receive normalized text, and packaged HLS retains
its native text rendition for PiP and AirPlay. These modifications are
published under the LGPL at the exact source revision below. The bundled
acknowledgements include AetherEngine's complete license and exception plus
the GNU GPL version 3 text incorporated by LGPLv3.

- Exact source: <https://github.com/Silo-Server/AetherEngine/tree/f8239c206097c88b53492b281af15cf906c8295b>
  (fork branch `codex/silo-ass-subtitle-routing`)
- Upstream base: <https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/tree/6.67.2>
- Rebuild input: `Package.swift` and the source tree at that revision
- Bundled texts: `AetherEngine-LGPL-3.0-App-Store-Exception.txt`,
  `GPL-3.0.txt`

The exception permits Apple App Store and TestFlight distribution despite
store signing, DRM, and relinking restrictions. It does not waive source-code
obligations: the exact-revision link above must stay current for each release,
and any downstream modifications must be published under the LGPL. The fork
branch above is that publication; keep it public for as long as builds that
link this revision are distributed.

## FFmpegBuild and its component libraries

AetherEngine's `AetherEngine` product depends on FFmpegBuild's umbrella
product. The resolved FFmpegBuild manifest links all of these as separate
dynamic frameworks:

| Frameworks | Upstream input | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AetherLibavcodec, AetherLibavformat, AetherLibavutil, AetherLibswresample, AetherLibswscale, AetherLibavfilter | FFmpeg `n8.1.2` (currently `38b88335f99e76ed89ff3c93f877fdefce736c13`) | LGPL-2.1-or-later |
| AetherLibdav1d | dav1d `1.5.4` (currently `54706fc6bc0cdecab7e9593974a4039cc038fca7`) | BSD-2-Clause |
| AetherLibzimg | zimg `release-3.0.6` (currently `f819b14e8f39d1282400b0d9543e8ef73c1b2bbd`) | WTFPL-2.0 |
| AetherLibzvbi | libzvbi `v0.2.45` (currently `d3a5ee9f2b047bf16cd1ee5ccf6ec05ee75409d0`) | LGPL-2.0-or-later, conveyed under LGPL-2.1; `src/ure.c` is MIT |

FFmpegBuild 3.0.0 renamed every target, framework bundle, and install name
with an `Aether` prefix so the build can coexist with another FFmpeg in the
same app; the binaries are the same as 2.5.0. The exact FFmpegBuild 3.0.0
`build.sh` is the rebuild recipe and patch record:

- it builds FFmpeg with dynamic linkage and does not enable GPL, version-3,
  or nonfree FFmpeg components;
- it removes libzvbi's three GPL-family source files (`packet-830.c`, `pdc.c`,
  and `exp-vtx.c`) before compilation and publishes the LGPL replacement stubs;
- it records its FFmpeg, dav1d, zimg, and libzvbi tags and every downstream
  patch applied to those sources;
- it does not build the FFmpeg `concat` demuxer, which 2.5.0 removed.

libzvbi 0.2.45 is the GHSA-86rm-g7qf-j2fh security update (out-of-bounds
read, out-of-bounds write, integer underflow reachable through the teletext
decoder). The commit IDs in the table are the tags' dereferenced values
observed on 2026-09-04. FFmpegBuild's script records tag names rather than immutable
upstream commit IDs; recording the dereferenced commits here pins them if the
tags ever move. Forking the pinned FFmpegBuild revision is cheap,
commit-immutable insurance if stronger provenance is ever wanted, but the
exact-revision links satisfy the source pointer as they stand.

A tvOS Simulator debug build against FFmpegBuild 3.0.0, inspected on
2026-09-04, embeds exactly the nine `Aether`-prefixed frameworks in the table
under `SiloTV.app/Frameworks/`, its `AetherLibavcodec` configure string
contains `--enable-shared` without `--enable-gpl`, `--enable-version3`, or
nonfree enablement, and the app binary exports no `avcodec_`/`avformat_`
symbols of its own. Repeat this inventory against each release archive;
debug evidence is not a release substitute.

  <https://github.com/superuser404notfound/FFmpegBuild/tree/421e13be7061de67d91b85ac34a6b22a002b164f>
- Current upstream tag resolutions:
  [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/tree/38b88335f99e76ed89ff3c93f877fdefce736c13),
  [dav1d](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d/-/tree/54706fc6bc0cdecab7e9593974a4039cc038fca7),
  [zimg](https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg/tree/f819b14e8f39d1282400b0d9543e8ef73c1b2bbd),
  and [libzvbi](https://github.com/zapping-vbi/zvbi/tree/d3a5ee9f2b047bf16cd1ee5ccf6ec05ee75409d0)
- Bundled texts: `FFmpegBuild-LGPL-2.1.txt`,
  `dav1d-BSD-2-Clause.txt`, `zimg-WTFPL.txt`, `libzvbi-ure-MIT.txt`

No GPL-licensed FFmpeg or libzvbi object is expected in this package. That is
an evidence statement about this pinned build recipe and inspected binary, not
a substitute for a final release archive scan.

## LibDovi and libdovi

LibDovi's packaging and rebuild script are MIT licensed, Copyright (c) 2026
Vincent Herbst. Its `Dovi.xcframework` contains the static `dolby_vision`
3.4.0 crate built from dovi_tool tag `libdovi-3.4.0`, exact upstream revision
`d1abe0e27ff2c7ab3339614d06db9f8a058af6b2`, under the MIT license,
Copyright (c) 2026 quietvoid.

As with FFmpegBuild, LibDovi's rebuild script clones the tag name rather than
an immutable commit. The commit above is the tag's value observed on
2026-09-04; preserve the actual release source alongside the static library.
LibDovi's packaging `LICENSE` describes the embedded crate as dual MIT or
Apache-2.0, but the exact `libdovi-3.4.0` source's `LICENSE` and Cargo manifest
declare MIT. The bundled files reproduce the packaging license unmodified and
also include quietvoid's controlling MIT text; this notice uses MIT for the
embedded crate.

- Bundled texts: `LibDovi-Packaging-MIT.txt`, `libdovi-MIT.txt`

## Nuke and NukeUI

Nuke and NukeUI are distributed under the MIT license, Copyright (c)
2015-2026 Alexander Grebenyuk.

- Bundled text: `Nuke-MIT.txt`

## ThumbHash decoder

Silo includes an adapted copy of the ThumbHash Swift decoder, distributed
under the MIT license, Copyright (c) 2023 Evan Wallace. Only the image decode
path is retained; Silo adds bounds validation, cross-platform image creation,
and a bounded asynchronous cache around the reference algorithm.

## Release checklist

The dynamically embedded FFmpeg libraries and the statically linked SwiftLibass
libraries use different rebuild paths. Before App Store, TestFlight, or other
external distribution:

1. verify the release archive embeds the FFmpegBuild libraries as separate
   dynamic frameworks and does not merge or statically link them into the app
   binary (the debug-build inventory above is not a release substitute);
2. confirm the revisions in this file and in the bundled acknowledgements
   match what the release actually resolves in `Package.resolved`;
3. if AetherEngine or any LGPL component was modified, publish the modified
   source under its license before shipping;
4. publish the matching `Silo-source-<app-commit>.tar.gz` archive, with the app
   source, pinned Swift packages, SwiftLibass dependency sources, revision manifest,
   and rebuild instructions, before distributing a binary that links SwiftLibass.

## Local ASS rendering

Silo uses SwiftLibass 1.4.0 for libass bindings and SwiftAssRenderer 1.3.1
for image compositing on all three Apple clients. Both Swift packages are MIT.
The native libraries are libass 0.17.3 (ISC), Fontconfig 2.15.0, FreeType 2.13.2
(FreeType License), FriBidi 1.0.14 (LGPL-2.1-or-later), HarfBuzz 8.5.0, and
libpng 1.6.43. Their full notices are bundled in `OpenSourceLicenses/`.
This product uses the FreeType project.

The native XCFrameworks contain static `.a` libraries and headers. Silo links
the libraries without embedding subtitle framework wrappers or generated stubs.

- SwiftAssRenderer source: <https://github.com/mihai8804858/swift-ass-renderer/tree/28919f6b5ddd896d327b0283f8d97624902236e6>
- SwiftLibass source and binary artifacts: <https://github.com/mihai8804858/swift-libass/tree/6513c488e377a26c06db327fb2acfc2653a041d5>
- Rebuild entry point: `build-libraries.sh` at that revision.
- Transitive Swift dependencies: Combine Schedulers 1.2.2, Concurrency Extras
  1.4.1, and Issue Reporting 2.1.0, all MIT; exact revisions are in
  `Package.resolved` and their notices are bundled.
- The test-only `SiloASSFixture.ttf` is an original rectangular glyph
  generated by `iosApp/Tests/Fixtures/ASS/generate-font.py`; it is not shipped
  in the application.

### Source-based relinking

FriBidi is statically linked. LGPL 2.1 section 6(a) allows the work that uses
the library to be supplied as source code or object code so a recipient can
modify the library and relink the application. Silo uses the source-code path;
the app is distributed under the repository's AGPL license.

The TestFlight and sideload workflows publish a source archive to GitHub
Releases before their binary jobs run. Tag-triggered builds attach it to the
same tag as the binary release. Manual TestFlight builds publish it under
`source-<app-commit>` and include its URL in the build's What to Test notes.
External local TestFlight uploads require `SILO_RELEASE_SOURCE_URL` to point
to the matching published archive. Other distribution channels must publish
these materials and provide their location alongside the binary as well.

`scripts/ci/package-release-source.py` captures the committed app tree and
every resolved Swift package, plus immutable snapshots of SwiftLibass's six
native libraries recorded in `scripts/ci/swift-libass-sources.json`. The archive
includes a pinned ffmpeg-kit builder and a local build entry point that skips
its destructive checkout step, preserving a recipient's edits. `REBUILD.md`
explains how to build and relink through local package overrides. Signing
credentials and untracked configuration are excluded. `revisions.json` records
source revisions and checksums.

SwiftLibass's upstream script clones an unpinned ffmpeg-kit branch. The builder
and native source tags recorded here match its documented prebuilt versions;
upstream does not publish a manifest establishing byte-for-byte provenance of
those prebuilt libraries. The supplied rebuild inputs are pinned independently.

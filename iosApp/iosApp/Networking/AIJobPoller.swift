//
//  AIJobPoller.swift
//  Silo (iOS + tvOS)
//
//  Generic poller for an AI subtitle job. Emits each fetched ``SubtitleJob``
//  snapshot on a fixed cadence and stops once the job reaches a terminal
//  state (`completed` / `failed` / `cancelled`).
//
//  The `fetch` closure is injected rather than the live ``SiloAI``
//  facade so the poller is unit-testable headless — a fake `fetch` can
//  return a scripted sequence of snapshots (see `AIJobPollerTests`). In
//  production the caller passes `{ try await SiloAI.shared.subtitleJob(id: $0) }`.
//
//  This is the authority/fallback layer under the (M4) live websocket path:
//  the poller owns `result_subtitle_id` and the completion handoff, so a
//  dropped socket still completes the job over polling.
//

import Foundation

/// Polls a single AI subtitle job to completion, surfacing every snapshot.
///
/// `actor` so the in-flight poll Task and its cancellation are serialized
/// independently of the `@MainActor` controller that drives it. The
/// returned ``AsyncStream`` finishes when the job becomes terminal, when a
/// fetch keeps failing past the retry budget, or when the consuming Task is
/// cancelled (cancelling iteration tears the producer Task down via
/// `onTermination`).

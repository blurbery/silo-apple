/// Cached holder for whether the server has any external subtitle providers
/// configured (`GET /api/v1/subtitles/providers/status`), used to render the
/// in-player "Search Subtitles…" entry point as *disabled with a reason*
/// rather than letting it run a search that can only ever come back empty.
///
/// Without this probe, a server with no providers wired up answers
/// `POST /api/v1/subtitles/search` with `200 {"results": null}` — so the user
/// picks a language, waits out the 20–30s provider fan-out timeout, and gets
/// "No subtitles found for English.", which is indistinguishable from a real
/// empty result. That has already been reported as a broken feature when it
/// was only ever an unconfigured one.
///
/// Structurally this follows the ``AICapabilities`` / ``RequestsFeatureStore``
/// precedent: a `@MainActor` `@Observable` singleton, probed once per session,
/// reset on sign-out and profile/server switch, with a `generation` counter so
/// a probe that lands after a switch discards its result instead of
/// repopulating the next account's flag.
///
/// ## It FAILS OPEN — deliberately inverting the sibling stores' convention
///
/// `AICapabilities` and `RequestsFeatureStore` both treat a probe failure as
/// "feature off": a 404 there means an older server that genuinely lacks the
/// feature, so hiding the entry point is correct.
///
/// **This store must do the opposite.** Subtitle provider search shipped long
/// before its status endpoint did, so every server that predates the endpoint
/// 404s here while having a perfectly working search. Defaulting to disabled
/// would regress all of them at once. Therefore:
///
///   - ``isAvailable`` starts `true`, before any probe has run.
///   - A 404, a network error, a decode failure — anything short of an
///     affirmative answer — leaves it `true`.
///   - Only an explicit `{"enabled": false}` from a server that *does*
///     implement the endpoint may turn the entry point off.
///
/// The wire model (``SubtitleProvidersStatus``) carries the same bias: a
/// missing `enabled` key decodes to `true`, not `false`.
///
/// Reset + refresh hooks live in `AuthService`/`ServerRegistry`/`ContentView`
/// next to the existing `AICapabilities` calls.

//
//  SubtitleAIController.swift
//  Silo (iOS + tvOS)
//
//  Per-session orchestrator for the in-player AI subtitle suite — translate
//  an existing text track, transcribe audio (Whisper), or transcribe-and-
//  translate. Owned by ``PlayerViewModel`` and constructed/reset alongside
//  the playback session lifecycle.
//
//  Milestone 3 ships the complete feature over **polling**, the same contract
//  the Android client uses:
//    POST /subtitles/ai/translate  →  store the job  →  poll
//    GET  /subtitles/ai/jobs/{id}   until terminal    →  on `completed`,
//    fetch GET /subtitles/{media_file_id}, locate the result subtitle, and
//    register it as a normal downloaded sidecar track (then auto-select it).
//
//  Milestone 4 (now) layers REAL-TIME cue streaming over the websocket on top
//  of that polling authority. The POST now passes `session_id` (the active
//  playback session) so the server streams cues live; a ``LiveSubtitleCoordinator``
//  drives the started→pause→synthetic-track→resume→handoff→fail experience
//  while the poller keeps running underneath as the source of truth for
//  `result_subtitle_id`. The websocket and the poller SHARE ONE terminal
//  action — the persisted-track handoff — guarded by `handoffJobId` so the
//  track is registered exactly once regardless of which path wins. When the
//  socket is unavailable (`PlaybackRealtimeClient.isRealtimeUnavailable`) the
//  controller behaves exactly like M3: poll, no live cues.
//
//  Isolation: `@MainActor @Observable` so the UI binds its state directly and
//  all mutations stay on main. The networking lives behind the ``SiloAI``
//  actor and the ``AIJobPoller`` actor, which hop back to main when delivering
//  snapshots.
